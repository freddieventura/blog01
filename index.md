# Blog

Welcome to my blog, in here I will post my writtings regarding to the stuff I am passionate about, you may be passionate as well about this so you landed in here, there are going to be different kinds of articles:

- Tutorials. 
- Thoughts. 
- News (in English). 
- Music Projects. 


## Tutorials

To make my way to here I had to polish my workflow thoroughtly, in order to make things work simple I had to work hard into checking different kinds of software and its installation and handling, therefore I had to spend a huge amount of hours *researching*, *reading documentation*, *checking* etc... So we all do I guess. I have written down most of the processes in order to make it simple to undestand it for myself shall I not use much one functionality or a software and I have to review it again, hence I'm publishing this guides in here in the form of Tutorials, hopefuly someone else will find this useful appart of me.
 
The phylosophy behind the software I use can be describe with the following adjectives: 

1. **Keyboard-oriented**: Every process must be able to be done using the keyboard interface of a computer, no mouse, no other device, resulting on a *lack of distraction's* creative/working process.
2. **Lightweight**: All the software must be able to be runned in *mid-low range* laptops and computers. Cause we have got hardware that is over-capable for the necesities we have, shall we avoid fancy GUI's and other mainstream lazy-people oriented software, the current devices are able to handle professional software that is and was industry standard for decades and that has given birth to awesome creations and will do so.
3. **Portable**: This feature is a little bit consecuence of the above mentioned two, as the purpose is to carry a simple laptop with keboard, install the programs first and create wherever you may be. And should you change your device have always a simple *backup system* to restore this swiftly.

## Thoughts

For this I am gonna take the typewritter and punch some characters on the virtual paper.
This entries will be about **thoughts** of topics I am pasionate about ranging from:

1. **Politics**. 
2. **Economics**. 
3. **Linguistics**. 
4. **Phylosophy**. 
5. **IT**. 
6. **Sociology**. 
7. **Music**. 
8. **Writting prompts**.

etc, etc...

## Translated News

This is a little personal project I may want to make it's own website one day, as I read *news/articles* in *English* and *Spanish* sometimes is not a bad practice to translate them one into the other language and share it with the world, so I feel myself obligued to go through specific vocabulary in topics and practicing at the same time the **translation of text**


## Music Projects

Is been a while since I've been chasing this and I have to put my project on halt due to lack of time, but in here I will be posting some **beats** done with software that follow the phylosophy above. The intention of this is to create a paralell website as well, but at the moment everything will be really amateur and raw and will be kept in here.
